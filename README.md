# Weather App

This project's goal is to build weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using the Open Weather API
My web app is also responsive, with different versions for mobile, tablet and desktop.

## How I built it - What I learned

To be able to fetch weather data i used JavScript's fetch() method to get all the data from the Open Weather API. This was my first time working with an API, so I learned about understanding the documentation and how to use API URLs and keys.
The HTML elements showing the data gathered from the API are created dynamically on JavaScript. 
I've learned several new methods while building this project such as the Date() object in combination with the toLocaleTimString() method, which I sm using to get weekdays and hours but also how to dynamically create HTML elements and when to use this approach instead of having already hard-coded HTML.
